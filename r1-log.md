## Log

### R1D1 
I completed the freeCodeCamp tribute page project.  I have been working on it since 12/09/17.  It was a simple project that helped me get familiar with the Bootstrap framework. https://codepen.io/T341/pen/yPmbKp

### R1D2
Today I did a few JQuery exercises on SoloLearn https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/6539943 I will most likely use the library on the freeCodeCamp Portfolio Page Project.

### R1D3
I spent some time figuring out the layout & creating wireframes for my freeCodeCamp Portfolio Website project.  Nonetheless, I was able to get some actual coding done through several JQuery exercises on SoloLearn.    

### R1D4
I did more JQuery exercises today and saved some of my code on SoloLearn (public & private).

### R1D5
I worked on my freeCodeCamp portfolio page today.  I didn't make as much progress as I wanted but I'm still learning what I need to know.

### R1D6
Today I continued to work on my portfolio page project.  I was able to dolve a problem that lingered from yesterday.  All it took was patience and a couple of google searches.  

### R1D7
I continued to work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio page project.
