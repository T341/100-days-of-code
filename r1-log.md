## Log

### R1D1 
I completed the freeCodeCamp tribute page project.  I have been working on it since 12/09/17.  It was a simple project that helped me get familiar with the Bootstrap framework. https://codepen.io/T341/pen/yPmbKp

Today I did a few JQuery exercises on SoloLearn https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/6539943 I will most likely use the library on the freeCodeCamp Portfolio Page Project.

### R1D3
I spent some time figuring out the layout & creating wireframes for my freeCodeCamp Portfolio Website project.  Nonetheless, I was able to get some actual coding done through several JQuery exercises on SoloLearn.
