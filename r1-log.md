## Log

### R1D1 
I completed the freeCodeCamp tribute page project.  I have been working on it since 12/09/17.  It was a simple project that helped me get familiar with the Bootstrap framework. https://codepen.io/T341/pen/yPmbKp

### R1D2
Today I did a few JQuery exercises on SoloLearn https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/6539943 I will most likely use the library on the freeCodeCamp Portfolio Page Project.

### R1D3
I spent some time figuring out the layout & creating wireframes for my freeCodeCamp Portfolio Website project.  Nonetheless, I was able to get some actual coding done through several JQuery exercises on SoloLearn.    

### R1D4
I did more JQuery exercises today and saved some of my code on SoloLearn (public & private).

### R1D5
I worked on my freeCodeCamp portfolio page today.  I didn't make as much progress as I wanted but I'm still learning what I need to know.

### R1D6
Today I continued to work on my portfolio page project.  I was able to dolve a problem that lingered from yesterday.  All it took was patience and a couple of google searches.  

### R1D7
I continued to work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio page project.  



### R1D8
I continued to work on freeCodeCamp portfolio project. 

### R1D9
I continued to work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio project.  I also looked a a couple of videos, code, and instructions on how to use animate.css. 

### R1D10
I did a little bit of work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio project.  I somewhat solved a problem but, my solution actually caused a new problem! 

### R1D11
I'm still working on my freeCodeCamp portfolio project. 

### R1D12
Today I continued to work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio page.  I've been working a little slow the last few days but, I am making progress.  I'm going to take a break and get back to it in a couple of hours.

### R1D13
Today I continued to work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio project.

### R1D14
I got started late today but I'm making progress on my freeCodeCamp portfolio project.  I also did a quick Bootstrap / CSS review earlier today.

### R1D15
 I worked on my freeCodeCamp project today for about an hour.  That's All I could do today.

### R1D16
Today I worked on updating my GitHub repositories.  I had to make a few changes in order to transfer files from CodePen to GitHub.

### R1D17
Today I did more work on my freeCodeCamp protfolio project.  I a took a couple of steps back and started working on an older forked copy of my project.  I made a few mistakes and felt like it would be better to rebuild.

### R1D18
Today I continued with my freeCodeCamp protfolio project.  I'm a little under the wather today and did a minimal amount of work.

### R1D19
Today  I worked on my #freeCodeCamp portfolio project.  I  had some trouble with the way one of my elements responds to a change in screen size.  I still think I can figure it out but, things are going a lot slower than I anticipated.

### R1D20
Today I took a break from my portfolio project and did a few JQuery exercises.  

### R1D21
Today I tried something different.  I hand wrote my code on a piece of paper without using the internet.  I got some things wrong and some things right.  I'll continue to do this periodically just to test how much information I'm retaining,

### R1D22
I did some work on my freeCodeCamp portfolio project.

### R1D23
I continued to work on my freecodeCamp portfolio page.  This project should have been relatively easy but, I attempted to do a few things that were outside the scope of the user requests and beyond what I've learned so far.  I realize that I need to start working more systematically and give the users what they want and not what i think they should have.  In any case, I expect to be finished with this in the next few days.

### R1D24
Today I continued working on my portfolio page project.

### R1D25
